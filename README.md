## ü§î **What is ReflexOS?**

ReflexOS is a modified version of Windows 10 & Windows 11, which removes nearly all the drawbacks of Windows that negatively affect gaming performance.
ReflexOS is also a good option to reduce system latency, network latency, input lag, and keep your system private while focusing on performance.
You can learn more about ReflexOS on our official [website](https://reflexos.heo-systems.net).

## üëÄ **Why ReflexOS?**

### üîí More private
Stock Windows contains tracking services that collect your data and upload it to Microsoft.
ReflexOS removes all types of tracking embedded within Windows and implements numerous group policies to minimize data collection. 

Note that ReflexOS cannot ensure the security for things outside the scope of Windows (such as browsers and third-party applications).

### üõ°Ô∏è Windows Defender & Windows Update are in ReflexOS!
Windows Defender and Windows Update are removed from many different custom operating systems. We know that the majority of gamers are not particularly tech savvy and cannot manually update or maintain their computer secure, which can be a major security risk. Therefore, we remain to use those features to keep you safe.

### üöÄ More space
Pre-installed applications and other insignificant components are removed with ReflexOS.
Check out what else we have removed in our [FAQ](https://reflexos.heo-systems.net).

### ‚úÖ More performance
A few custom operating systems on the internet have made Windows incompatible with essential functionality like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, among others.
ReflexOS is on the sweet point. While preserving a high level of compatibility, it seeks to increase performance.

Some of the many changes that we have done to improve Windows are listed below:
- Customized power scheme (Credits: Chris Titus)
- Reduced amount of services and drivers
- Disabled audio exclusive
- Disabled unneeded devices
- Disabled power saving (for personal computers)

### üîí Legal
Many custom Windows OSes distribute their systems by providing a tweaked ISO of Windows. Not only it violates [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm), but it is also not a safe way to install.

ReflexOS uses Powershell script to modifdy an existing Windows installation, so no need to install a custom Windows ISO. Installing ReflexOS on an outdated installation of Windows 10 or 11 is strongly discouraged!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
ReflexOS is **NOT** a pre-activated version of Windows. You **MUST** use a valid key to activate Windows. Before buying a Windows 10/11 (Professional or Home) license, be sure the seller is trustworthy and the key is legitimate ‚Äî no matter where you buy it.

ReflexOS is based on Microsoft Windows. By using Windows, you agree to [Microsoft's Terms of Service](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Useterms/Retail/Windows/10/UseTerms_Retail_Windows_10_English.htm).
